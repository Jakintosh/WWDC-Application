Application for WWDC Scholarship 2013


Written by Jak Tiano from April 27th - May 2nd 2013.

This is a basic app that is meant to present data
to the user. I opted to experiment with interesting
visuals. Spent about 10 hours concepting/writing
this application, as the start/end date for this
scholarship fell over the weekend that I was moving
home from college. Either way, I'm happy with how
this turned out as a proof of concept.

Works on 3.5 and 4-inch displays in the simulator.
